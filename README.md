As the name suggests it's classic tic-tac-toe I have just created for my website, there are several changes that need to be done on this app. It's a beta version with low graphics and css.
The app is complete in its functionality, you can play the game with its the basic user interface it's made using react so it's working fine.
I have created three-component for the app -
1. Squares- where you can enter your input(X or O) to play the game.
2. Board - board contains the square in row-column format.
and 3. Game - Game manages the action on the board (OnClick actions). It takes care of the winner and moves.

The app consists of only one database which has three things
1. History of moves
2.Step
3.Next Move
So depending on next move, steps need to take to create history.
